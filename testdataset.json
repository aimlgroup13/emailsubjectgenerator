Britt Whitman at ex:5-4014 or Kristin Walsh at ex:3-9510.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY ?\nSenate May Seal SoCal's Fate ?\nSoCal Edison Eyeing Bankruptcy   California Senate & SoCal's Fate  With the California Assembly's passage of SB 78XX last week, Senator John Burton (President Pro Tem) is positioned as perhaps the most legislatively powerful man in California.\nMaintaining his hard line against the Assembly's amendments to SB78XX, Burton has completely rejected SB78 XX and has instead revived a previously introduced Assembly bill (AB 67XX), which had not faced a Senate floor vote.\nThe majority of AB 67XX's original language has been gutted by Burton and discretely replaced with the following points:  ?\nFinancing of the dedicated rate component has been modified to incorporate a smaller rate base consisting of consumers using only 70 kv or more (formerly users as low as 20 kv were included).\nThe 70 kv value is rumored closer to 120 kv.\n?\nThe state will have a 5-year option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets at twice book value and SoCal will be allowed to transfer profits from the sale to their parent company.\n?\nA renewables portfolio equal to 20% of total generation must be in place by 2010.   ?\nThere is an 11.6% return on generation in the bill.\n?\nThe amount authorized for SoCal's bond issuance has been lowered from $2.9B to $2.5B.\n?\nDirect access language has been included in the bailout bill.\nThe exact language, which was developed by Senator Bowen's office, is not yet known, however, earlier versions suggest that all parties will be forced to pay exit fees, switch providers no earlier than 2003, and there will be no cost shifting away from the DWR.\n(Note: Senator Burton is reportedly listening carefully to Treasurer Angelides' arguments about the revenue bonds not selling if direct access is included.)\nIt is doubtful that Burton will insist on the loyalty of fellow Democrats and will preferably discourage the bill's support.\nThe arrival of AB67 XX on the Senate floor may be little more than Burton's civil compliance with Gov.\nDavis' request.\nAll Republicans and at least 5 Democrats are expected to vote against the bill; an additional two dissenting Democrat votes would effectively block AB67 XX.\nConsumer advocates that adamantly oppose this bill (because it lacks the state's ownership of hard transmission assets and burdens residential consumers with excessive rates) are \"optimistic\" about the bill's defeat in the Senate.\nDespite these circumstances, it is highly conceivable that the Senate could pass along a virtually ineffective & inadequate bailout package for the Assembly's approval.\nBurton is reportedly avoiding discourse with Davis over AB67 XX and as the hours pass ever closer to the midnight deadline, Burton will likely introduce the bill for floor vote and then hurriedly adjourn the Senate.\nIf the bill passes, the Assembly will bare the difficult task of either accepting the bill as is, or reject the bill and risk SoCal's bankruptcy.\nWe believe that if the bill makes it into the Assembly, AB67 XX will pass despite strong opposition from both the CTMA and consumer advocates.\nThere is no current vote count available in the Assembly, but we expect the Assembly to debate the bill into the early hours of Saturday morning.\nInside Edison  There are still strong indications that even if a bailout plan is passed, SoCal will voluntarily file for bankruptcy or a creditor, most likely a generator, will take them into bankruptcy.\nSoCal remains concerned due to the number of contingent claims on their cash (by the DWR, etc.)\nand appear likely to try to protect these cash flows.\nFrom the generators' perspective, if a plan is passed, the bank creditors will get paid but they will not.\nAlso, the DWR and ISO have not resolved even what amount is owed to generators for power they have provided this year, let alone when they will be paid.\nThe total amount owed through the ISO is approximately $2B.\nNonetheless, the generators remain under a federal order to provide power to the state.\nOnce a deal is passed leaving too little money for SoCal to pay the generators, this will leave them with little means of satisfaction other than filing against SoCal.\nSoCal has privately indicated to Senators that if the AB 67XX fails to include any consumer using 100 kv or more as the base for the dedicated rate component, SoCal will be forced to file for bankruptcy because of their inability to effectively securitize the bailout bonds.\nSoCal feels that this rate base is too small and the risk of these businesses fleeing the state is too high.\nThe CTMA also has indicated that some of its members may leave the state to avoid having to pay the extra surcharge on power.\nSoCal has not communicated a position on whether the $400 million trim (from the original $2.9B) puts them into bankruptcy.\nWe estimate that an additional $400 million hit is indeed too much to bear and would prompt a voluntary bankruptcy petition.",

This is a rough era for American business icons.\nSubject to the vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business.\nThe latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.\nOnce considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest.\nThe journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage.\nWe hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.\nWe agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed.\nHigh profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms.\nBut no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.",

Britt Whitman at ex:5-4014 or Kristin Walsh at ex:3-9510.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMRAY ?\nCPUC Settles Filed Rate Doctrine Case with SoCal ?\nCPUC Kills DWR Rate Agreement, Davis May Reconsider Old Senate Bill     CPUC - SoCal Suit In a closed hearing today, the California Public Utilities Commission voted 5-0 to settle its filed rate doctrine case with SoCal Edison.\nThe implications could save SoCal from an otherwise immanent bankruptcy, though bankruptcy remains a real threat.\nUnder the agreement, the CPUC has stipulated the following points, which have not yet been formalized by Administrative Law Judge, Ronald Lew:  ?\nThe CPUC agrees to maintain a level of rates necessary for SoCal to pay off under-collect through 2003.  ?\nAll surplus revenue (revenue above O & M) generated from any source must be applied to SoCal's back debt.\n?\nSoCal agrees to pay no dividends on its common stock from now until 2003, or until all back debt has been recovered.\nIf SoCal's debt has not been recovered by 2003, the CPUC will extend appropriate rates levels necessary for SoCal to recover its debt through 2004.  Dividend payouts on SoCal common stock will be subject to CPUC approval during this extension.\n?\n100% of any revenue SoCal receives/generates from FERC/generator refunds will be applied to SoCal's debt.\n?\nOnce SoCal's back debt has been recovered, any surplus revenue generated from the CPUC rate hikes will be refunded to ratepayers.\nCPUC - DWR Rate Agreement The fact that the PUC voted down the DWR rate agreement (by a 4-1 margin) puts Governor Davis and Treasurer Angelides in a very awkward position.\nThis leaves Senator Burton's bill, SB 18XX, as the vehicle that sets to payment path for the revenue bonds to repay the General Fund.\nHowever, as late as this morning, Governor Davis vowed (through his spokesman) that SB 18XX was \"dead on arrival\" and would be vetoed.\nThis move by the PUC puts pressure on Davis to sign SB 18XX in order to protect the bonds and the long-term power contacts he has negotiated.\nHowever, 18XX violates the terms of a number of the long-term power contacts negotiated by the governor earlier this year.\nFor example:   ?\nSB 18XX splits the revenue streams for payment of the General Fund's revenue bonds and payment to the DWR for power.\nIt clarifies the funds that will go to repay the General Fund, but is much less clear on the funds to pay the DWR for power.\nSB 18XX leaves the long-term contracts signed by the governor open to review and renegotiation - something that the governor remains publicly unwilling to do.\n?\nSB 18XX also violates the terms of the bridge loan the state negotiated with Shearson Lehman earlier this year.\nThe terms of the bridge loan explicitly state that if 18XX is passed, the banks can accelerate the loan or impose penalty terms of interest on the state.\nThese terms were suggested by the governor as a means of forcing the legislature to support his DWR rate agreement rather than Burton's.\nOf course, this effort failed when the legislature easily passed SB 18XX.\nToday's PUC action further complicates the situation.\nWhile on the surface this would seem to force the governor's hand into signing SB 18XX, that may not, in fact, happen.\nIt would not be out of character for the governor to instead veto SB 18XX, then force either the legislature or the PUC to \"play ball\" with him in order to repay the General Fund.\nThus, another leverage point has been created.\nWe will continue to monitor the situation to attempt to determine the likelihood of Davis signing or vetoing SB 18XX.",

(FEIN: not listed) 2000 - Harrier Power Corporation (FEIN: not listed)  Please complete the attached questionnaire for each acquisition with as much information as possible.\nIf the acquisition did not involve employees, just complete the top portion of the questionnaire and answer questions 1 and 2.\nIn reference to question 5, since it is unlikely that you have access to such detailed payroll information, if you could provide the states in which the predecessor had employment, we will then be in a position to contact state agencies to gather more detailed information.\nThank you for your assistance in this process.\nIf you have any questions, please call me at (713) 237-5346 or Janice at x37839.\nOnce the questionnaires have been completed, please return them to me via e-mail at alexa.r.cutter@us.andersen.com.\nSincerely,",

Zell Miller have it exactly right in their editorial proposal to slash cap gains, accelerate the depreciation of investment in plant, equipment, and technology, and make the phased-in personal tax-rate reductions effective immediately.\nTheir monetary view that the Federal Reserve should abandon its interest rate target in favor of larger emergency cash injections is also correct.\nSo, why aren't administration economists endorsing these bold measures?\nWhy aren't they making the case that it's business that creates jobs, and that business desperately needs a fresh capital infusion?\nNo amount of consumer tax rebates will stop the unemployment rate from rising if capital-starved and profit-losing businesses don't get immediate relief from a permanent reduction of tax-rates.\nBush policymakers should also make the case that the twin crises of war and recession will require a temporary budget deficit of roughly 1.5% of GDP ($150 billion) to finance tax-cuts, defense, and infrastructure-rebuilding policies that are necessary to re-ignite economic growth.\nThe public is four-square behind the president in the global war against terrorism.\nIt will also stand four-square behind the president in the war against recession.\nIndeed, the public knows that a strong domestic economy is vital to the war effort.\nSince President Bush's spectacular speech rallying the nation for the global war against terrorism, the Dow Jones stock index has appreciated 7%, or roughly 600 points.\nIf the president rallies the nation with a war plan to end recession, the market will rise exponentially, signaling economic recovery and the revival of the American spirit.",

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This article was originally published earlier Friday.)\nLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Department of Water Resources, the agency purchasing a bulk of the state's power needs in lieu of the three investor-owned utilities, is expected to tell state regulators Friday that they need to increase electricity rates by as much as 25%.\nThis is because there are insufficient funds in the current revenue stream to cover a $13.4 billion bond sale, three commissioners with the Public Utilities Commission told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday.\nPUC President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue a draft decision Friday either endorsing the rate hike request or calling for an audit of the DWR's current revenue stream before she makes a decision, aides in her office said.\nIf the PUC determines that there are not enough funds in the current rate structure to cover the bond sale, it will have no choice but to order the rate increase, according to the legislation that put the state in the power buying business.\nBusinesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase, the second in just two months, if approved by the PUC, the commissioners said.\n\"Back in May when we ordered the first rate increase, we said we may be forced to do it again by the summer,\" one commissioner said.\n\"It's unfortunate, but it shouldn't be a shock to anyone.\nThe state has made an enormous commitment to Wall Street that rates would go up whenever it's needed to ensure there is enough money to pay off those bonds.\"\nLynch and a spokesman for the DWR were unavailable for comment late Thursday.\nSeparately, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has drafted a proposal expected to be introduced into the Assembly Friday or Saturday that would have large businesses using the most electricity to finance the bulk of the $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts, aides in his office said.\nMoreover, Keeley's plan is aimed at reducing rates for consumers who use the least amount of power.\nDetails of the plan are still sketchy, aides said.\nPossible Rate Hike To Generate $2.5B Yearly For State  The 50% rate increase ordered in May is expected to generate $5 billion annually, and if the PUC orders a 25% increase, that is expected to generate $2.5 billion.\nHowever, it is still unclear if that is enough, the commissioners said.\nBusinesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase, the second in four months, if approved by the PUC, the three commissioners said.\nSince January, the state has spent nearly $8.5 billion buying electricity on behalf of customers of Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric.\nThe state has borrowed more than $7 billion from its general fund, which must be repaid by ratepayers at 6% interest, to purchase power.\nIn addition, the state has locked itself into $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts at high prices for as much as 20 years to ensure there is enough power to meet demand.\nFuture rate increases to finance the contracts are likely, state officials have said.\nBut if the PUC orders another rate increase, the money won't benefit the utilities, which have billions of dollars in power costs to recover.\nInstead, it will be used to guarantee Wall Street financial institutions that there is sufficient funds in the rate structure to allow $13.4 billion in revenue bonds to be sold.\nThe bonds are expected to be sold in August or September, said state Treasurer Phil Angelides.\nThe commissioners said the PUC and the DWR waited to address another rate hike to see if state officials and generators were successful in coming to terms on $8.9 billion the state says it was overcharged for power since last year.\nAfter two weeks of hearings between generators and a delegation of California utility executives and energy officials, talks broke down Monday.\nGenerators offered the state $716 million in refunds, but Gov.\nGray Davis balked, threatening to sue to recover the full $8.9 billion.\nAny refunds would have been disbursed to the utilities and the DWR, which could have deferred the need for any rate increase, according to Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis.\nAn administrative law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said Thursday he will recommend that the commission not order cash refunds to California because the state's utilities owe far more money to the generators than what he thinks the state is owed.",

        "input": "Tony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate  pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it  must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some  other basis.\nIt seems a simple enough extension of the principle that  capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.\nHowever, I did not  find any case that stands for that exact proposition.\nAs you may be aware,  the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up  with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory  basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to  its shippers.\nNGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, and  there is a whole line of cases if you're interested.\nThe underlying  presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is  awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting  discriminatorily.\nBut of course the Commission never comes out and says this  even though it should be obvious.\nProbably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA  (doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim.\nbasis?).\nAlso, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers  of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the  capacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), we  will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to  participate in the auction process.\nMaybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the  effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the  Enrononline process.\nNow for some trivia.\nRemember we were discussing with Shelley whether we  could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for  determining best bid?\nIn my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case.\nIn Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,335, the Commission stated:  \"The  Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season  provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid  evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing  different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different  transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology  before the bidding process begins.\"\nThe only problem is I am not sure we  have that \"flexibility\" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post  a different method.\nMaybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some  language allowing us to do so.\nI have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what  you write I'd be happy to.",

        "input": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ?\nSeveral procedural scenarios that might play out regarding the Edison MOU.\n?\nA snapshot analysis of the political dynamics that affect the outcome.\nProcedural Scenarios   Assembly  The Assembly Appropriations Committee's plan to take up SB 78XX today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full Assembly on a party line vote.\nWhile the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of Friday's draft bill, it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend.\nIf the problematic \"Shaver Lake\" provisions are removed from the bill, Assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill (although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition).\nIf the Shaver Lake amendments remain, several Central Valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee.\nAssembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg supports this Edison deal, and the business community supports some recent amendments.\nThis likely mitigates concerns from other pro-business Democrats.\nWith or without the Shaver Lake provisions, Hertzberg should get at least 41 Democratic members (and probably a few more), but no more than 2 Republicans (if any) to vote Aye on the bill.\nHertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus - he needs 41 votes for the bill to pass, and there are 50 Democrats in his caucus.\nIf the vote is close, a personal plea from him and/or the Governor should enable him to get to 41.\nSenate  The bill would next move to the Senate for approval of the Assembly's amendments.\nThis is where the prognosticating gets difficult.\nSenate President pro Tem John Burton has said he does not support any amendments to SB 78xx.\nGov.\nDavis and Speaker Hertzberg will likely meet several times with Burton to try to cut a deal, but relations between Davis and Burton are currently frayed (due to a variety of factors), and Burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position.\nThis would lead to one of four scenarios:  ?\nBurton refuses to have the bill heard in the Senate, and no Edison MOU bill is approved before Sept. 15th,  ?\nBurton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition (this option is unlikely),  ?\nBurton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg and brings the bill (as it is passed by the Assembly) for a         vote in the full Senate with his support, ?\nBurton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg, but as part of the deal, he insists on changes in the bill - thereby sending it back to the Assembly for more amendments, and another vote in the Assembly - before a vote in the Senate.\nJohn Burton is considered one of the smartest, and certainly the cleverest politician in California state government today, so it is problematic to guess his next move.\nAdditionally, external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result.\nFor instance, the Governor may be willing to cut a deal with Burton on an unrelated issue that Burton cares more about resolving his way (e.g.\nworkers compensation benefits, drug courts, reapportionment).\nForetelling what will happen in the Senate is extremely difficult.\nBut Davis and Hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him, and given Burton's past actions, he may string them along, holding out for several days (maybe even until Sept. 14th) before he agrees to anything.\nGovernor  Assuming the bill escapes the Senate (and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes) the Governor will almost certainly sign it, regardless of Edison's public position.\nThe bill will go into effect 90 days after the Governor signs it.\nConsumer groups have vowed to undo any \"Edison bailout\" enacted into law by way of the ballot box.\nThat could be either (1) an initiative to pass another bill overturning SB 78xx and replacing it with other provisions, or (2) a referendum to repeal SB 78xx, making it as if the bill was never passed at all.\nInitiative  Once drafted and submitted to the Attorney General, it takes 15 days to receive an official title and summary, and another 25 days if the AG determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary.\nAfter either the 15 or 40 days, the Attorney General sends it to the proponents, the Senate, the Assembly, and the Secretary of State.\nThe day it is mailed is called the Summary Date.\nThat is the day upon which all calculations are made.\nThe proponents are allowed a maximum of 150 days to circulate petitions and collect signatures.\nHowever, the initiative measure must qualify at least 131 days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters.\nTherefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election, on March 5, 2002 (statewide primaries), and so, could not qualify until the statewide general election on November 5, 2002.\nHowever the window is tight for that election, as well, and a proposal would need to be submitted to the Attorney General by the end of September 2001 to qualify for November 2002.\nThe legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative, but cannot amend it.\nSo whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot.\nAn initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for Governor in the preceding gubernatorial election (419,260 signatures).\nThe ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers.\nIt seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of money quickly, but Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights has been successful at placing pro-consumer initiatives on the ballot before, including Prop.\n9 in 1998, which sought to undo AB 1890 before the public understood its ramifications.\nReferendum  Referenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives, although a successful referendum was on the March 7, 2000 ballot.\nPrior to that, the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the June 1982 primary election ballot.\nAll four were defeated.\nSince 1912, there have been approximately 50 attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot.\nOf the 50 attempts, 39 qualified for the ballot, 26 of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect.\nThe circulation calendar, verification, timing, and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives.\nFor example, the California Constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of the enactment of the bill that is being referred.\nThe signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute, though.\nPolitical Dynamics  Notwithstanding the Governor's and Assembly Speaker's desire to enact an Edison rescue package, Senate President pro tem John Burton is in the driver's seat.\nIn fact, as noted above, there is a perception among some that it is the Governor who needs Burton and not the other way around.\nOne business source close to the negotiations believes Burton is not inclined to ask his members to make a second vote for an Edison bailout.\nIn fact, members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility, their reluctance fed by generators' lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess and oppose any bailout.\nCurrently, due largely to this dynamic and others such as the Shaver Lake issue, there are not 41 votes for an Edison rescue in the Assembly.\nWe believe this will change as the Governor and the Speaker exert their influence, and the bill will pass the Assembly.\nAs difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the Assembly, the state Senate presents an even larger challenge.\nHowever, at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an Edison rescue package being approved by the state Senate are less than 50 percent.",

JENKINS, JR.\nThe big news this summer is that Californians haven't been reduced to stone-age lifestyles, running naked in the streets and eating each other.\nThe state barely had enough electricity to get through this past winter, when demand was not yet pumped up with air-conditioning.\nYet here they are surviving the summer with nary a blackout.\nGov.\nGray Davis must be some kind of a wizard, pulling 15,000 megawatts from his pointy hat.\nHe gave every indication of being a hapless cluck, but obviously we underestimated him.\nNaah.\nCalifornia's summer of surplus demonstrates just how flukey last winter's rolling blackouts were.\nPower there was aplenty (or at least enough to get by).\nWhat there wasn't was anybody to pay for it, thanks to the political system's paralysis as the state's private utilities ran out of cash and used up their credit trying to keep the lights on.\nWe won't rehearse the central pinion of this catastrophe, a \"deregulation\" plan that created scarcity pricing in the absence of true scarcity.\nA tweak here and there as late as last fall could have saved the state's taxpayers and ratepayers literally billions of dollars at no real cost to anybody.\nInstead, the utilities were allowed simply to run out of money, accumulating $14 billion in unpayable IOUs to generators.\nNow, most of us tend to think of power plants as giant coal or nuclear operations that run 24 hours a day, supplying \"baseload\" power.\nBut the majority of plants are part-timers, firing up to meet intermediate and peak demand.\nRevving up their turbines means incurring fuel, labor and maintenance costs, which means operators like to get paid.\nThe crisis months saw three distinct waves of blackouts, each related to plants dropping off line simply because they feared not getting paid.\nIn January, it was British Columbia Hydro, the big, government-owned operator of Canadian dams, which had kept California afloat on credit for months.\nIn March it was dozens of small California generators, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" which no longer could meet their own fuel and labor bills because they weren't getting paid by their utility customers.\nIn July, it was the federal government imposing impenetrably complex price controls across the West, making it impossible for generators to know what price they were allowed to charge.\nSome shut down rather than take a chance, and since the federal intervention meant the entire region was on the griddle for California's mismanagement, the blackouts just happened to land in Nevada.\nThere was no shortage, in other words, no \"energy crisis.\"\nThere was only the unaddressed credit problems of the utilities.\nWe opined in January that Californians would be surprised at how quickly power prices return to normal.\nYup.\nThe state threw open the treasury to pay for the power the utilities could no longer afford and suddenly sellers were everywhere and prices fell.\nIn the teeth of peak air-conditioning season, electricity prices are now back to normal.\nIn retrospect, what's amazing is that so many plants not only kept operating month after month despite being stiffed by the state, but produced 62% more power than they had the year before to keep California lit.\nYet they've gotten nothing but abuse from the governor, who is still turning over every legal stone to try to avoid paying the IOUs.\nThere is no question that Western supplies were tighter than usual thanks to low water levels in Northwest river systems.\nBut the evidence shows that Western markets were flexible enough to accommodate the glitches.\nAll they needed was a creditworthy customer to deal with.",

        "input": "As per your request, an environmental due diligence was completed of the  assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWNG), a  local distribution company  (LDC), with its corporate headquarters located in  Portand, Oregon.\nThis  due diligence, which was conducted on August 7-9,  2001,  was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures  which may be associated with  NWNG and identify and evaluate the  environmental risks associated with each issue.\nA relative risk number  between 0 and 3 has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential  risk impact.\nA rating of \"0\" indicates that there is no risk associated with  this regulation or issue and a rating of \"3\" indicates a major problem or an  issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure.\nAn approximate cost   value has also been assigned to each discipline.\nIt is to be understood and  explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost, conservative  estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair, remediate or  formally close each issue.\nPresented below, by discipline, are the environmental activities which impact  and affect NWNG.\nThe evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is  based upon the availability of records, documents and discussions with NWNG  personnel.\nTherefore, this summary report is limited to the availability of  information presented.\nGeneral Pipeline Characteristics ;  This is a dry pipeline system.\nNo pipeline liquids are generated, only small  volumes of compressor oils are collected.\nAll cast iron pipe has been removed from the system.\nThere is still approx.\n100 miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future.\nThe only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage,  and underground injection and storage reservoir (10.5 bcf storage capacity).\nthis is a non Title V major source.\nNWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their  underground storage capacity.\nNWNG is planning a 60 mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of  2002.\nAll environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the  agencies.\nLandslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern.\nNWNG has  completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas.\nEnvironmental Procedures Manual.\nThe NWNG environmental procedures manual   appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format.\nThe topics  covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company  appeared to be involved with.\nThe manual addressed waste management,  permitting,  disposal and environmetal stewardship.\nThere was also a written  statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNG's commitment to  enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG.\nRisk: 0  Cost: $0  Notices of Violation (NOV)/Notices of Noncompliance (NON).\nIn a summary  page provided by NWNG, a list of all state and federal agency actions against  the company was available.\nAlthough the company had received a few  notices  (<10), they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small  recordkeeping and right of way issues.\nThere were no outstanding judgements,  NOVs, NONs or pending agency actions or  issues to be resoved.\nRisk: 0  Cost: $0   PCBs.\nIn interviews with NWNG, they attested to the fact that they have  never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected.\nAlthough NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company,  the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system  was unknown.\nRisk:  1  Cost: $0          Mercury.\nMercury was used on the NWNG system, but only in monometers and  not in natural gas metering equipment.\nA decision was made by environmental  management of NWNG in 1986-87 to remove mercury manometers.\nAn investigation  has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers  or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment  which may have been used.\nRisk:  1  Cost:  $3,000-$40,000  Onsite Disposal.\nOther than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas  plants, in interviews with NWNG's environmental management, they were not  aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous, toxic or non hazardous  waste.\nRisk:   1  Cost:   undefined  Hazardous Waste.\nThere is only one location where hazardous waste is  generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is  used.\nThis site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity  generator.\nThe remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous  waste.\nRisk: 0  Cost:  0   NORMS.\nThe environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually  occurring radioactive materials (NORMS) are not a problem in the pipeline  system.\nTesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this, nor does  NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest  Pipeline Company.\nRisk:  1  Cost:  $500  Underground Storage Tanks (UST).\nThere is only one regulated underground  storage tank (UST) remaining on the NWNG system (Albany), and this tank is in  complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring, testing and  recordkeeping.\nAll other underground tanks have been removed.\nAt one of the  tank removal sites, there exists  an active remediation in progress.\nClosure  of this site is expected in the near future.\nRisk: 1  Cost: $500  LNG plants.\nIn interviews with NWNG environmental management, there are no  histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural  gas (LNG)  plants.\nThe exception to this is a historic site of a  manufactured gas plant (Linnton site) which underlies the LNG plant.\nThis  issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas  Plant.\nRisk: 0  Cost:  $0  Manufactured Gas Plants.\nNWNG owned and operated  a number of manufactured  gas plants (MGPs).\nPresented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had  operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks.\nEugene Water and Electrical Board.\nThe City of Eugene has determined that  a  parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by   numerous  responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time  period of 1958-1976.\nThe Eugene Water and Electrical Board  (EWEB), which is  the regulatory agency in Eugene,  has determined that the total cost to clean  the entire area will be approximately $1,300,000, of which  the EWEB has  indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be $93,750.\nNWNG has offered to pay  compensation damages in the amount of $70,000-90,000 to  be relaesed from all  liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City  of Eugene.\nThe environmental management of NWNG  has stated that the EWEB  has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG  offer of approximately  $94,000.\nRisk: 1-2 Cost:  $94,000   Salem Site.\nAccording to NWNG management, this historic MGP site has been  remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem, which is the    regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site.\nNWNG has received  endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature.\nRisk: 1   Cost: $0   Manufactured Gas Plant.\nThis site, which ceased operation in the early  1900's, was dismantled and  abandoned.\nFrom the time the facility ceased   operations, untill the present, a railroad has constructed a steel rail  bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park.\nThe site is  immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River, a major perennial  watercourse in Oregon.\nThere have been no soil, groundwater or river/ river  sediment   studies  completed  to determine potential environmental impacts.\nNWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds  of  London.\nThe insurance policies were not available at the time of this  due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this  site.\nRisks: 2-3 Costs: 0-$300,000,000  Portland Harbor Superfund Site.\nThe Environmetnal Protection Agency has  determined that the Portland Harbor, on the Wilammette River,  has received  contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify  the 6.7 miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site.\nThis superfund site extends  for a distance of 6.7 miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites,  originally owned by NWNG.\nThe EPA has designated approximately 69 primary  responsible parties  which are directly or indirectly involved in the  contamination of this section of the Willamette River.\nNWNG has been  identified as a contributing member to the contamination.\nLinnton MGP/Wacker Site.\nThe Linnton MGP and Wacker Site, has 47 acres of  water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the  Portland  Harbor Superfund Site.\nThe Linnton facility, which originally included the  Wacker Site,  initiated operation in 1913 and ceased operation in 1956.\nDuring the operation of the  facility operation,  various organic coal tar  wastes, comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) and dense non   aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) were generated.\nCharacteristically these  waste products include: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), BTEX  and  cyanide.\nDuring the early stages of facility operation, these wastes  were  originally directly deposited into the Willammette River, and then later, in   1941 unlined ponds were constructed at the facility.\nPreliminary  investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility  operations which  were released either directly or indirectly into the soil  underlying the facility or into the Wilamette  River were in excess of 4.6  million gallons or 23,000 cubic  yards.\nIt was also estimated from these  reports that there is approximately 250,000 cubic yards of tar and tar mixed  with soil underlying the historic tar  ponds.\nNegotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to 20 or more  years.\nNWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of  London   which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNG's portion  of this superfund responsibility.\nThe policies were not availble during the  due diligence  to verify or confirm the amount of coverage.\nAdditionally,  because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the  subsurface soil,   groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not  been determined, it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be  evaluated.\nIt  should also be mentioned that because the proportionate  extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known, adequate insurance  coverage  appears to be somewhat premature.\nRisk:  3  Cost:  $50,000,000-300,000,000",

Says First-Quarter Profit Rose 20 Percent  Houston, April 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, said first-quarter profit rose 20 percent as sales almost quadrupled.\nProfit from operations rose to $406 million, or 47 cents, from $338 million, or 40 cents, in the year-earlier period.\nEnron raised its 2001 profit forecast to $1.75 to $1.80 a share, from its January projection of $1.70 to $1.75.",

Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling.\nUpdate since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.\nGood news is that at  MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.\nThe third round  of sampling taken at this location is not available.\nAll other samples  collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to  be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.\nLine 311 is a 12 in.\nline which travels  north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.\nPrevious testing  showed non detect.\nMost recent sample showed 22 ppm.\nSecond sample has  been collected but results are not available.\nSamples are proposed to be  collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.\nThere is a potential for the IMC Plant  to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is  considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's.\nKern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.\nThe  gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas  Co.  system which is PCB free.\n3.\nDiscuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency.\nWest end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.\nThe east end of the system  has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.\nSampling frequency for these  locations is once every two weeks.\nWhen a sampling location is shown  to  have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the  sampling program.\nTranswestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs  under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the  pipeline system.\nAt the present time a small nipple is inserted into the  bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.\nBy  increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced.\nIt was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the  separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks.\n4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators.\nOriginally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter  separators.\nThese locations were considered Priority 1 sites.\nThe  determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1)  a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of  the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm.\nBased upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station)  have been added to the list of Priority sites.\nFlow through at the Kern  River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.\nSamples collected at this location have  shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.\nPG&E's agreement with SoCal at this  location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.\nPG&E has indicated that  there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume  of gas deliveries.\nPG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional  filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer  load at these locations.\nSouthwest Gas feels it needs additional protection  at these sites.\nPG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express  additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations.\n5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators.\na. Siting, Design and Engineering   b.\nCost Estimates   PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus  an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next  week.\n.\nFour of these separators have been installed.\nA total of 45 filter  separators may be proposed for installation.\nThe cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29  indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.\nThe sampling costs have  not been included in this number.\nEstimates are being reviewed on a per sites  basis as PG&E presented.\nOne PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions  of their plant that has PCB's.\nPG&E is in discussions with the cement  company.\nPG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the  success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the  cement plant prior to committing to any action.\nIf the deconning occurs, it  will be a 2001 project.\n6.\nOngoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection.\nCompressor Oil Control.\nThe majority of liquids collected at strategic  sampling locations is compressor oils.\nTranswestern has requested access to  the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.\nThere are 22 compressors at the  Topock and Hinkley C/S's.\nTranswestern will conduct a  study of technologies  to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.\nEarl will  coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle.\n7.\nOther Issues or Concerns.\nEarl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January,  2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to  Transwestern.\nPG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300  mmscf/day cap by May 15.\nOver time PG&E will look into their C/S  configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day.\n8.\nNext Steps.\nThe next meeting was proposed in 45 days.\nThis time period will allow  inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection    additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.\nThe location  of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as  some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on  other business.",

        "input": "Folks, Here's some preliminary comments on the model we are using for Argentina.\nPlease correct me on any misunderstandings!\nModReg was written by consultants in Buenos Aires.\nDocumentation is available in Spanish only.\nAll data input is by means of text files, which require column orientated input, ie numbers must go into specific columns.\nDetailed documentation has been provided specifying the data format for each file.\nA weekly time step is used, with five load blocks per week, and a time horizon of one year, typically.\nEach model run requires about 6 hours of processing.\nModReg is a modified version of the model used by the grid operator.\nIt is coded in Fortran and requires a CPLEX licence.\nCPLEX is a powerful linear programming solver, developed by ILOG.\nAs the model is written in Fortran, the very good higher level interface to CPLEX is not available, so the code will have to access CPLEX at a lower level.\nWe have no documentation describing how the model algorithms.\nSource code is not available at present.\nModReg appears to model around 30 busses and 71 lines.\nLines are characterised by from bus number, to bus number, maximum MW capacity in each direction, a percentage  loss factor, cost of transmission in each direction, and some other details.\nDemand data is specified by week and load block for each bus.\nThermal plants have a heat rate and maintenance schedule specified, with the possibility of multiple fuels.\nI understand that hydro generation schedules for each historical inflow condition are an input to the model as they are calculated elsewhere.\nFrom the above it appears that we have an unsatisfactory situation: \tModReg is difficult to use \twe do not know in detail what the model does \twe do not have documentation describing the algorithm  \tbecause source code is not available, we are completely dependent on the consultants.\nIf Enron is to continue modeling Argentina, we should as a minimum have a model that we understand, is reasonably easy to use, and is documented.\nA graphical user interface is really needed to make ModReg easier to use.\nDocumentation is of course essential.\nWe should not use a model developed by consultants without documentation.\nThese steps would enable us to have more confidence in model results, and shortens the learning curve to enable more people to use model.\nSDDP is likely to be a suitable replacement.\nIt would require reseroir inflow data rather than the calculated generations.\nThe regional loads etc could be modeled using the DC loadflow feature, with zero impedance lines.\nTransmission losses in SDDP are a quadratic function of power flows, so some guesses would have to be made for line resistence values.\nSetting up an SDDP model to represent all the aspects included in ModReg would be a time consuming job, that would require a good undertanding of the data for both models.\nSome direct cut and paste of data from one model's files to the others will be possible with a suitable column oriented text editor.\nHowever the end result would be a model with the desirable attributes of documention, GUI interface, and flexible output.\nTom Halliburton",
